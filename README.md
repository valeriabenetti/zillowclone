#Zillow Clone
## The Iron Yard Cohort 7 Weeks 5-9

### Objectives
Build a house shopping app to compete with Zillow/etc.

Use bootstrap to your advantage

Do use my bootstrap generators if you desire.

However:

  * It cannot look like default bootstrap

  * It cannot look like bootstrap-generators

  * You MUST strongly modify the default scaffold views. This means likely NOT using tables, etc.

  * You MUST create your own styled app. Each student's style should be unique and personal.

  * The app should have a landing/marketing page to show off the name of the app.

  * It should have links to sign up, log in as well as view homes

  * The landing/marketing page must use a different design than the rest of the app

  * Like most web apps these days the landing/marketing page should "sell" the visitor on why they should use the app

  * Convert the search to be a jQuery + Ajax where it updates the search results for every keystroke

  * Change the pagination links to be Ajax enabled so that clicking on the pagination link refreshes the list of homes based on what link was clicked.

  * If you haven't added the multiple image size processing for your home images, add that.

  * Update your home show page to have "small", "medium", "large" underneath the image. When you click on those words, pop up a modal dialog that shows that size image

  * Add the ability to "favorite" ("heart", "star", etc.) a house by clicking on an icon shown along with the image. The request to favorite the house should be an ajax request and NOT force a page refresh. Always show the favorite/heart/star for that user for that house. Allow the user to "unfavorite" (etc) the house as well.

  * Change your logout such that when clicked shows a modal dialog to confirm the user really wants to logout.

  * On your home index and home show page, where you show the square footage for the house, clicking on that information changes the text to show the size of the home in square meters.
